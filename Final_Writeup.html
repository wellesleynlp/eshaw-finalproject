this project, I wanted to focus on the interdisciplinary aspect of
the NLP field. At the same time, I wanted to add to my data scientist
toolkit, since this is the field I will be pursuing my graduate
degree in. The result was a final project that focused less on the
creation of algorithms, but an implementation of existing algorithms
(as part of the SciKit-Learn Python package) to conduct character
similarity analysis on Shakespeare's characters. The chosen topic
stemmed from my inherently interdisciplinary interest (I am a liberal
arts student, after all), but particularly because as an aspiring
data scientist, I didn't want to simply play with data â€“ I wanted
to see what story the data could tell, to discover the connections
hidden within the data. I naturally gravitated towards Shakespeare's
work for two reasons. The first being that the only information
provided for each character in plays are the words spoken and actions
taken by the characters themselves. And so, natural language
processing seemed highly compatible with this nature of character
analysis. And while there are many plays to choose from,
Shakespeare's work has fascinated people for centuries and the
characters, as well as stereotypes, he created are renown. </font></font></font>

<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">Having
no better inspiring place to start, I began considering the project
from a literary perspective. For Shakespearean scholars, there are
three realms of considerations that shape any analytical comparisons
among various Shakespearean characters.  The first considers
characters based on how their beliefs and actions change over the
course of the play<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Some characters change from outstanding moral citizens to vengeful
murders, some go from sworn bachelors to bring married, and others
remain stubbornly unchanged over the course of events in the play.
While this analysis approach gives a lot of complexities, the
temporal consideration based on morality and characters' decisions
would be a hard approach to translate into a computation equivalent. </font></font></font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.38in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 152%; orphans: 1">
<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">The
second realm of consideration analyses characters within the larger
realm of Shakespeare's common themes<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Some character personae will include the suspicious lover, the leader
risen to power via mutiny, the witty young lady seeking a suitor etc.
This approach of considering characters within their contextual
themes paired well with existing information retrieval inherent in
Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency statistical analysis. This
analysis would be able to separate out characters from similarly
themed situations, whether this is in their role within the play or
the genre of play that they are in. Due to the high number of
components associated with this analysis, I modified the results to
lower the number of dimensions using Principle Component analysis
(PCA) and used only the most distinguishing dimensions across all
characters. While TF-IDF would give the vocabulary context for each
character, I also needed to account for the clear genre divides which
would make distinguishing characters from similar genre plays less
distinctive. Fortunately, this was something that the third approach
somewhat resolves.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">The
third literary approach to takes on the historical context of these
plays being consistently played by the same set of actors<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>.
It is known that Shakespeare often wrote his characters with the
physical attributes and acting abilities of his actors in mind. As
such, there should be a natural connection among characters from
different plays based on the actors that portrayed them. Converting
this form of analysis to a computational equivalent was less straight
forward. If Shakespeare's characters were written to be played by
specific actors, I hypothesized that actors would have some sort of
verbal acting ticks that would permeate the different characters in
similar roles. Here, I took inspiration from the work of Bamman et
al.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>
which considered film characters based on grammatical dependencies
inherent in the chosen verbs, adjectives, and noun modifiers
associated with each named character. The work, however, considered
third party summary descriptions of characters whereas Shakespeare's
characters own their own set of diction. Considering the characters
based on the verbal ticks of the actors, I was interested in looking
at the verbal ticks associated with the distribution of active versus
passive verbs, as well as the distribution of descriptive attributes,
and the amount of modifiers.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">With
two somewhat unrelated considerations on hand, I needed to find a way
to combine the two into a meaningful entity. The timing of the topic
covered in class led me to consider vector space. Within the context
of vector space, I would not need to forcefully combine the two
entities, but could consider them as orthogonal dimensions. With this
set of features in place for describing each character in
quantitative form, the next consideration was how one would measure
similarity. I naturally began with cosine similarity, since it was
covered in conjunction with vector space. But the results were too
granular; for each character, I could list the set of others that the
character most closely, or distantly, resembled, but it didn't give
me a whole picture on how all characters were inter-related. </font></font></font>

<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">I
set out to look for character personae, which implicated a group of
characters. The need to group characters naturally led me to k-means
clustering. And while this method was not as conducive to identifying
opposite character groups, it gave a clearer big picture look at
similar characters. In the end, while the original goal of my final
project was reached, my curiosity took over and I was interested in
seeing how consistent the results from these two similarity analyses
were. I wrote a function that calculated the percentage overlap
between the two results.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.38in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 152%; orphans: 1">
<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">The
first set of results divided the set of 443 primary characters into
66 clusters (a number that was chosen based on minimizing inertia and
optimizing inertia change). The overlap between cosine similarity and
cluster similarity was at 56%. As the percentage suggests, the
results were mixed, which also included clusters made up of one
single character. The isolation of these individual characters were
not convincing, as many of them were very much considered iconic
figures (such as Othello and Brutus) which should have resembled a
handful of others theme-wise (it is coincidental that both these
character were historically played by different actors). For the more
populated clusters, there were a few successful results which
included a cluster which grouped Romeo, Cleopatra, Prospero, and
Leontes together, all of whom are some of Shakespeare's more
melodramatic characters. Perhaps it was due to the number of possible
clusters, but most clusters did not show a clear theme of division.
For example, my favorite poorly paired character set included Titus
Andronicus, Mark Antony, and Rosalind, all of whom are as different
in dispositions from the others as Romeo is from Othello.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.38in; border: none; padding: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 152%; orphans: 1">
<font color="#444444"><font face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt">At
12 clusters, the overlap between cosine similarity and clustering is
100%. Here, looking at the smaller clusters (there are 3 large
clusters that act as miscellaneous groupings) , we start seeing some
promising groupings. We see a cluster containing some of
Shakespeare's stronger female characters including Lady Macbeth, Joan
of Arc, the nurse from Romeo and Juliet, Queen Elizabeth, and Helena
from Midsummer. Other renowned strong female characters ended up in
the miscellaneous groups, which is unfortunate, but more accurate
than if they were grouped elsewhere. In another cluster, we see some
of Shakespeare's Tragic leaders including Mark Antony, King Lear,
Othello, Brutus, and King Richard II. While these results are more
promising then the first run, there's a lot of information and
existing divisions that my analyses is not picking up on. The
pessimist in me would rather chalk up these few examples of
successful results to coincidence than some form of literary
accuracy.</font></font></font></p>

Many of my implementations are only first iteration considerations;
much of the future work that can be done in continuing this project
would focus on creating depth of analysis and feature generation.
Personally, through this project, I realized that the difficulty in
analyzing literature comes from the complexity of feature generation.
If I've learned nothing else from this class, it is that analysis
ends up doing better the more we are willing to let go of our human
understanding of language (letting go of linguistics; letting go of
traditional, human literary analyses). While it was interesting to
implement the computational equivalent of literary analyses, for
future work, I would focus a lot more on finding ways to generate
